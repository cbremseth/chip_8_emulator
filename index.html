                <p>
                    CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker made on his 1802
                    Microprocessor. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the
                    mid-1970s. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.

                <p>
                    This is a program that emulates the original Chip-8 architecture and instruction set in order to run
                    the original programs written for the Chip-8 in the past. Each of the games you can play here were
                    written by someone else for entirely different hardware on an entirely different system.
